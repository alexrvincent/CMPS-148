You read it aloud [Paragraph Break]'Nic, I can't do this anymore. You've taken too many film roles and I feel like I'm selling out by just being associated with you.  In the past decade you haven't taken one decent role! I feel like I'm the only one who believed you could change, you know, take up a reality TV show or something. But no, you're at rock bottom. Worst of all, you've gambled away all your savings and that fucking casino! Bah, whatever. You're probably too drunk to even read this.  The bottom line is I'm through playing your mother. You've disappointed me for the last time, Cage. I quit . [Paragraph Break] 'He's right' you say to yourself. You're getting old and the bank account is beginning to run dry. What could  you do to change your agent's mind? [Paragraph Break]As you turn around you notice a National Treasure poster hanging above your bed. 'GATES!', you yell. [Paragraph Break] 'I'm going to write National Treasure 3'.  ".
