Looking into the mirror you see a handsome slightly stubbled face. You are Nicolas Cage.  [Paragraph Break] In the kitchen sink you notice a letter, it's signed from your agent. You read it aloud [Paragraph Break]'Nic, I can't do this anymore. You've taken too many film roles and I feel like I'm selling out by just being associated with you.  In the past decade you haven't taken one decent role! I feel like I'm the only one who believed you could change, you know, take up a reality TV show or something. But no, you're at rock bottom. Worst of all, you've gambled away all your savings and that fucking casino! Bah, whatever. You're probably too drunk to even read this.  The bottom line is I'm through playing your mother. You've disappointed me for the last time, Cage. I quit . [Paragraph Break] 'He's right' you say to yourself. You're getting old and the bank account is beginning to run dry. What could  you do to change your agent's mind? [Paragraph Break]As you turn around you notice a National Treasure poster hanging above your bed. 'GATES!', you yell. [Paragraph Break] 'I'm going to write National Treasure 3'.  ".

Legend has it that Meriwether Lewis and William Clark were not an expedition simply to explore the West, but were actually in search of a hidden treasure. I never greally bought into it, but this note came from the President's Book of Secrets, so maybe you're on to something. I reckon you should pay a visit to the wax museam in Hollywood and check out what they have on Lewis and Clark.";
	else if the player's command includes "clue": 
		say "'Jon, would you take a look at this clue I found?' you ask. [paragraph break]Jon examines the revealed message and replies, 'Ahh yes, the Land of Oil.

		say "Jon replies, 'Not sure about that... Do you have any leads for another treasure?'"
		
Instead of examining Wax Clark:

	say "You notice Wax Lewis is carrying a compass and decide to touch it. Upon touch, it immediate falls, but your Cage-reflexes quickly catches it. Upon closer examination of the compass, you discover it's just a fake replica. Damn it! That can't be all. In all of your Cage-rage, you notice the placard next to Wax Lewis. It reads [Paragraph Break] 'Lewis was brains behind the expedition. Carrying the compass, now located in the Smithsonian, Lewis discovered what would later be the entire rest of the United States. In his journal he wrote, It was just sitting there, the entire west portion of the United States. I'm surprised I was the first to find it.'[Paragraph Break] The Smithsonian?
