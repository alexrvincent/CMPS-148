[Opening Line]

When play begins:
	say "Emerging in a drunken hangover from a wild party last night, you wake up in your king size bed in your extravagant apartment. You get up and go into your body mirror. Looking into the mirror, you see a handsome, slightly stubbled face. You are Nicolas Cage.  [Paragraph Break] On your nightstand you notice a letter; it's signed from your agent. You read it aloud :[Paragraph Break]'Nic, I can't do this anymore. You've taken too many film roles and I feel like I'm selling out just by being associated with you.  In the past decade you haven't taken one decent role! I feel like I'm the only one who believed you could change, you know, take up a reality TV show or something. But no, you're at rock bottom. Worst of all, you've gambled away all your savings at that fucking casino! Bah, whatever. You're probably too drunk to even read this.  The bottom line is I'm through playing your mother. You've disappointed me for the last time, Cage. I quit. [Paragraph Break] 'He's right', you say to yourself. You're getting old and the bank account is beginning to run dry. What could  you do to change your agent's mind? You must have at least one role that people should remember you for!  [Paragraph Break]As you turn around you notice a National Treasure poster hanging above your bed. 'GATES!', you yell.  Grabbing your camcorder from your bed, you turn around and say truimphantly: [Paragraph Break] 'I'm going to film National Treasure 3'[Paragraph Break] ".

Legend has it that Meriwether Lewis and William Clark were not an expedition simply to explore the West, but were actually in search of a hidden treasure. I never greally bought into it, but this note came from the President's Book of Secrets, so maybe you're on to something. I reckon you should pay a visit to the wax museam in Hollywood and check out what they have on Lewis and Clark.";
	else if the player's command includes "clue": 
		say "'Jon, would you take a look at this clue I found?' you ask. [paragraph break]Jon examines the revealed message and replies, 'Ahh yes, the Land of Oil.

		now the player has the five-dollar bill;
		now OprahDiscovered is true.
		
Instead of examining Wax Clark:

Instead of examining Wax Lewis:
	say "You notice Wax Lewis is carrying a compass and decide to touch it. Upon touch, it immediate falls, but your Cage-reflexes quickly catches it. Upon closer examination of the compass, you discover it's just a fake replica. Damn it! That can't be all. In all of your Cage-rage, you notice the placard next to Wax Lewis. It reads [Paragraph Break] 'Lewis was brains behind the expedition. Carrying the compass, now located in the Smithsonian, Lewis discovered what would later be the entire rest of the United States. In his journal he wrote, It was just sitting there, the entire west portion of the United States. I'm surprised I was the first to find it.'[Paragraph Break] The Smithsonian?

	else:
		say "You crawl down the dusty opening and into a secret candle-lit basement filled with sprawling notes, books, journals and posters";
		move the player to the Luxurious House Basement.
		
Instead of opening the stone coffin:
	end the story saying "You pry open the tomb with your bear Cage hands, seeing the skeleton of what remains of papa Bush. Clutched in his hands is a scroll. You unravel the scroll. It reads: [Paragraph Break] 'My son, I knew you'd find me. You are a Bush after all and I'm sure you inherited my wits.  I wish I could share this moment with you, but alas, I am dead.  I guess you've found my work on the lost city of oil. You must know nobody would believe me when I told them.  They all thought I was crazy and took the compass, but not before I was able to discover the final clue.  My son, Lewis and Clark made the compass point in the opposite direction of the true entrance! I too thought it was buried beneath the house I made for you in Texas, but we were wrong. As I lie on my deathbed, I pray you find this compass in the future and uncover what is so rightly ours. I love you, son. Don't give up. Also, make sure you get Florida when you run for election.[Paragraph Break]                                                                                Love, J. Bush. [Paragraph Break] The opposite direction he says? You, Cage, scratch your head in mystery and say to yourself, 'If that is true, then this must put the location to the entrance in ... New York City! I did it!' You release a loud Cage scream in triumph. You have done it. [Paragraph Break] Just then, a cloaked figure jumps on your back! You wrestle him to the ground and punch him out. As you're about to give your final punchline, another man whacks you on the head with a shovel, knocking you out. [Paragraph break] CLIFFHANGER! STAY TUNED FOR THE FINAL PART OF NICTIONAL TREASURE 3."
